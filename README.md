Sliding Window

sliding_window_1 - Given an array, find the average of all subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.<br/>
sliding_window_2 - Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’.<br/>
sliding_window_3 - Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.<br/>
sliding_window_4 - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.<br/>
sliding_window_5 - Fruits into Baskets (medium). Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.<br/>
sliding_window_6 - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring which has no repeating characters.<br/>
sliding_window_7 - Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ letters with any letter, find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.<br/>
sliding_window_7 - Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ letters with any letter, find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.<br/>
sliding_window_8 - Given an array containing 0s and 1s, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ 0s with 1s, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray having all 1s.<br/>

Two Pointers<br/>

two_pointer_1 - Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.<br/>
two_pointer_2 - Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the new length of the array.<br/>
