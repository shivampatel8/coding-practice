sliding_window_1 - Given an array, find the average of all subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.<br/>
sliding_window_2 - Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’.<br/>
sliding_window_3 - Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.<br/>
sliding_window_4 - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.<br/>
sliding_window_5 - Fruits into Baskets (medium). Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.<br/>
sliding_window_6 - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring which has no repeating characters.<br/>
sliding_window_7 - Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ letters with any letter, find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.<br/>
